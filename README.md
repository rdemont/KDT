KDT - Keep Dad on Track (sailing boat autopilot)


The goal is to create an autopilot for small sailing boat based on a old Autopilot and a arduino (WeMos D1 R1) 

componant : 
- WeMos D1 R1 
- GY-86
  * MPU-6050 Acceleration sensor
  * Gyroskop, HMC5883L Magneting compass 
  * MS5611 Barometer
- H-Bridge 

The first version will work with the manietic compass. Maybe next version will work with the GPS or the wind wirh a NMEA interface.
